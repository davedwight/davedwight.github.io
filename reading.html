				<h4 class="title" id="book"><a href="http://amzn.to/2eVsNGp">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</a></h4>
				<p class="description">A fascinating and lyrical novel about the Soviet 
				occupation of Prague, love, and literally everything else. It's got some 
				deep depths. </p>
				<p class="description">"The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That
				is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each
				one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It is that 
				crossed border (the border which my own "I" ends) attracts me the most. 
				For beyond that border begins the secret the novel asks about. The novel 
				is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in 
				the trap the world has become."</p>
				<h4 class="title"><a href="http://bit.ly/2dJbjdr">Turkey's Thirty Year Coup</a></h4>
				<p class="description">The most comprehensive explanation that I have 
				read of the forces contributing to the attempting coup in Turkey. While I 
				found it particularly interesting because of its explanations for much of 
				what happened this summer, it's also fantastic reporting on a covert, 
				mysterious, and simply strange underground movement in a country that 
				defies my understanding.</p>
				<h4 class="title" id="book"><a href="http://amzn.to/2fifLRY">Deep Work</a></h4>
				<p class="description">Imminently practical, pseudo-philosophical. This is 
				a practical handbook to finding meaning. The result, if done well, is a 
				perceived sense of meaning in your professional work - which is possible 
				because of the depth of attention and concentration you devote to it. In my opinion, this method 
				(deep work) won't solve the issue of "creeping nihilism" for all people 
				unless it is directed at something higher. Newport argues that there is 
				inherent meaning to deep work, to a craftsman, to deep concentration. I 
				mostly agree. It allows you to get closer to the root of things, what is 
				really going on, the thing itself. This book is about a method, but at 
				times it pretends to also be about ends. It doesn't adequately 
				answer where the inherent meaning to deep work comes from. It would be 
				ridiculous to expect such answers from this type of book - it is only 
				slightly irking that Newport pretends that he provides them here.</p>
