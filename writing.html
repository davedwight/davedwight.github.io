				<h2 class="posttitle" id="toptitle">Istanbul in the Summer</h2>
				<h4>11 November 2016</h4>
				<p>At 12:07 AM on 16 July 2016, a Turkish military fighter jet buzzed low 
				over the Bosporus. The sudden rumbling was so unexpected that I mistook the 
				noise for an explosion and scurried underneath the nearest cover. The 
				initial sound was faint compared to the deafening whoosh that swept over 
				and through the air as the jet screamed over us, its bright orange rear 
				leaving an impression against the black sky that remained against the back 
				of my eyelids when I blinked. </p>
				<p>I was standing just inside the bottom gate of the campus of Robert 
				College – a sprawling, heavily guarded forest that houses an impressively 
				large high school, which was my place of employment and home for the 
				summer. I was with eight others. Three Turks, three Americans, two security 
				guards. </p>
				<p>We arrived at the campus gate a few minutes before the first jet. We 
				remained there longer than expected because we were trying to negotiate 
				the entrance of two guests, both previous employees of Robert College’s 
				summer program, but the guards on duty were refusing to let them enter 
				without school ID’s. This problem could be solved pretty quickly on a 
				normal night. A quick phone call would sort it all out. But tensions were 
				above normal.</p>
				<p>After I was done staring at the orange tail of the jet’s engine in the 
				sky, I made eye contact with the younger of the two security guards. I 
				guessed that he was only slightly older than myself – maybe 23 or 24. He 
				had said nothing in the ten or so tense minutes we had been at the gate. 
				His eyes were wide open and his arms hung limply at his sides. He looked 
				weak inside his heavy frame as he looked from me and tentatively back 
				toward the sky. That moment was memorable because his reaction seemed to 
				be the same as mine.  Given that he was both a security guard and Turkish, 
				he had, in my mind, a sense of authority and understanding of the bizarre 
				situation at hand, yet he looked scared shitless.</p>
				<p>Earlier that evening, around 9:00 PM, I was worried whether or not I 
				could track down paper cups so we could drink wine in the park more 
				discretely than by taking pulls from a bottle in a plastic bag. I was 
				concerned that drinking alcohol in the park was not only illegal but might 
				also be offensive to others in the park. I didn’t have a good understanding 
				of how Muslims viewed others’ consumption of alcohol, much less an 
				understanding of which parts of Istanbul this view might differ. Was I 
				being culturally insensitive? This question mattered to me at around 
				9:15 PM. </p>
				<p>Around 10:00 PM, four friends and I left the park and walked north 
				along the European bank of the Bosporus towards a boat of friends of ours 
				for an evening cruise. I was still drinking red wine out of a paper cup 
				that I had found at a small convenience shop by the park. I spilled some 
				on my pants. I finished the wine. I looked for a trashcan. We gossiped 
				about the kids at camp where we were all working. We chatted about what 
				our other friends were doing that night. </p>
				<p>We found the boat and I found out that the boat was actually a yacht 
				and two crewmembers assisted us aboard. Before getting on the yacht, 
				Beyoncé (this is actually what I called her. We had camp names. 
				My name was Cactus) told us that the two bridges connecting the European and Asian 
				sides of the city were closed. It wasn’t clear why. It might be a bomb 
				threat – not an unreasonable thought given the airport bombing two weeks 
				prior and various other bombings over the past year. </p>
				<p>We asked our friends with the yacht if they knew of anything going on. 
				They knew as much we did. I walked to the bow of the boat where I looked 
				forward to a solitary, romantic moment looking out on the city of Istanbul. 
				I looked into the dark water, at the collage of yellow lights on the 
				opposite hillside, and at the red and blue lights of the Bosporus bridge 
				a mile to my right. I wondered what it all meant. Beyoncé told me to come 
				back to the stern. We might have to leave.  </p>
				<p>The three Turks were all flipping through Facebook, Twitter, and 
				WhatsApp and reported that a coup was under way. We knew what a coup was, 
				sort of, (we did have to clear up that it is pronounced ‘koo’ and not 
				‘koop’), but I was still enjoying the feeling of wine and hanging out on 
				a yacht. Eli Can (pronounced Ellie John), yacht proprietor #1, showed us 
				videos of tanks rolling through the streets of Ankara, Turkey’s capital. </p>
				<p>There’s a sentiment among the Turkish people I met this summer that 
				Turkey is a ridiculous country. Most were progressive and in the upper 
				class and thus mostly disliked the pro-nationalism, pro-Islam, and 
				authoritarian tendencies of Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
				There had already been about a dozen bombings or incidents blamed on 
				terrorism in the last year, attributed to either ISIS or Kurdish 
				separatists. After the shock, fear, and sadness subsided from the 
				<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/world/europe/turkey-istanbul-airport-explosions.html">bombing</a> 
				at Ataturk Airport, a few Turks said, essentially, “This is Turkey. What 
				do you expect?” It is with this context that our group absorbed the 
				information of the ongoing coup. The first thought was, “This ridiculous 
				country. What did we expect?” then “How bad is it?” then, “Are we safe? 
				What should we do?” Those turned out to be questions for the summer and 
				describe, in part, the tenuous situation still going on in Turkey. </p>
				<p>We were still docked along the boardwalk and I noticed that the steady 
				stream of evening walkers had thinned.  Only a few passed by and fewer 
				seemed calm. Most were talking on their phones and in a hurry. We were 
				getting updates from various friends and fellow counselors on WhatsApp 
				about what they knew or what they heard was happening. No one knew 
				anything for certain. Our boss ordered that everyone return to campus as 
				quickly as possible, which meant we had to leave the comfortable yacht 
				and head back to campus.</p>
				<p>We began walking; it was now around 11:00 PM, and fewer and fewer 
				people were on the streets. We quickly realized that finding a taxi would 
				be impossible because everyone in the city was also trying to get home. 
				It was a mile along the Bosporus back to campus so we decided to walk and 
				hoped we would be able to flag a cab on the way. </p>
				<p>We walked for about thirty minutes before someone 
				successfully got an Uber. Very few cars drove by. The few that did were 
				going very fast. I was attempting to explain American politics to 
				Eli Can. I guess I was trying to express empathy for Turks’ anxious 
				bemusement at the state of their country. “America is ridiculous, too!” 
				I implored. I was trying to sound smarter than I was and I’m sure Eli 
				Can knew it. What else do you talk about during a coup but politics?</p>
				<p>I overheard snippets of a story from behind me about a camper doing 
				something ridiculous. "This is serious," I thought. A coup is happening. No 
				time for levity. An image flashed in my brain of myself traveling to 
				far-off countries, writing about danger and about what it all means. I 
				was wearing all black in this image. I shook it off knowing I was 
				flattering myself as being smarter and braver than I actually was. I’m 
				just a guy working at a summer camp, I reminded myself. </p>
				<p>The seven of us piled into the Uber. We drove for about 500 meters 
				before stopping behind a line of traffic. We weren’t that far from campus, 
				about a ten-minute walk, but we were now in an area with a lot more people 
				and it felt more anxious. I, with an image of bravery and all black fresh 
				in my mind, stepped outside with one or two others to try to see what was 
				going on. From what I could see, police had stopped traffic. There was a frozen  
				line of cars coming from the south, the direction we were headed, that 
				wound out of view. We were close enough to the bridge that I could look 
				up and see no lights moving across. Two policemen opened the back of a 
				white van and two large dogs on chain leashes lumbered down into the 
				street. </p>
				<p>“Are police good or bad right now?” I wondered. It felt like a dumb 
				question to ask. We huddled up back in the Uber. “Well, what do we do? 
				Do we walk or stay here?”</p>
				<p>Whenever I left campus during the summer, I always had a Turkish friend 
				with me. I never went alone or in a group of only foreigners. Navigating 
				the city alone was an unnecessary obstacle when I had two dozen Turkish 
				speaking friends to come along. Taxi drivers frequently try to rip off 
				foreigners. There are no cognates between English and Turkish. To me, 
				the language looks almost comical in its density. I got used to having a 
				translator and tour guide with me all of the time. I developed a 
				dependence without realizing it. </p>
				<p>So, in a way, that moment inside the Uber, when we all looked at one 
				another in silence, waiting for someone to tell us what to do, was the 
				first moment in which I felt like I was really in Turkey. It was the first 
				moment when I didn't get an immediate response after asking “what next?”   
				My Turkish friends didn’t seem to know what was best any more than us 
				foreigners. </p>
				<p>We were all scared. We didn’t know if tanks were about to come rolling 
				down the street, if a bomb would go off, or if we would hear gunshots. None 
				of us had been out in the streets during a coup before. </p>
				<p>We decided to walk. After a few minutes of rising tension, it felt 
				good to take action, to move towards safety. We got off the main 
				road and walked through a small shopping district, Arnavutkoy, which we 
				were all familiar with. People were moving quickly. We passed an ATM with 
				a long line. Ten minutes later, we got to the bottom gate of campus. </p>
				<p>Our yacht friends left the gate after arguing with the school security 
				guards for about thirty minutes.  They had a twenty-minute walk home that 
				seemed pointless to risk knowing they would be safe on campus. Tension 
				was high because of all the uncertainty. But they left and we heard from 
				them later when they got home safely. </p>
				<p>That night was an obvious turning point in the summer. On one hand, 
				things became much less certain. Would I have to leave? Is it safe to 
				stay? Is it safe to leave? The ensuing purge and swell of nationalism 
				were and are still deeply concerning. On the other hand, conversations 
				about who was hooking up with who, why this or that camper sucked, and 
				how it’s hard to get Turkish kids to speak English were replaced by 
				conversations about political Islam, the rise of Erdogan in Turkey, and 
				the active role the Turkish military has played in its politics since 
				independence in the 1920s. Istanbul all of a sudden became the most 
				interesting place in the world to be. </p>
				<p>At around 1:00 AM, I got a Facetime call from a group of friends from 
				college who were in London together. I showed them the bridge from my 
				window, they could hear the gunshots echoing throughout the city, I told 
				them about the jets. I spent the next few hours drinking tea and musing 
				about Turkey in a dorm room with two Turkish friends. We listened to the 
				gunfire and read posts on Facebook from their high school friends.  </p>
				<p>No one wanted a coup. Many didn’t support Erdogan, but lamented that a 
				coup was seen as a solution. Some were already theorizing about who was 
				responsible. Some called on others to take to the streets and resist – an 
				act taken by thousands in response to Erdogan’s Facetime message from an 
				airplane, to the people of Turkey, encouraging them to go out and resist 
				the tanks. </p>
				<p>It is easy to romanticize that night. A friend from England was in a 
				different part of the city and spent the night at a friend’s apartment 
				close to Taksim square, where more violence was happening. It sounded 
				like explosions were going off when the jets broke the sound barrier 
				flying so low to the city.  In one version of the story, glass shattered 
				everywhere. His skillful, dramatic, and frequent rendering of the story 
				soon became the joke of the summer. “Have you heard about my night of the 
				coup?”  he would say to rollicking laughter. Turks would join in the fun 
				but didn’t seem to share humorous retellings of their own evenings. </p>
				<p>For me, and the other foreigners, the coup was a story. We were already 
				drafting our retellings while looking at tanks on the bridge. For the 
				Turks, the bemusement remained, which has its own flavor of humor, but 
				when we left with our tales of culture and adventure, they didn’t. Even 
				though the attempted coup, for a brief moment, allowed me to feel like I 
				was experiencing the reality of Turkey like a real Turk, it ultimately 
				pushed my world and the world of those I now know and care about in 
				Turkey, further apart. </p>
